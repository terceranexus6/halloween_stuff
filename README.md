# halloween stuff!! BOO000
funny stuff for halloween, arduino, scripts, and similar
just for fun.

steps:

1-Save and upload your program in arduino (either the lightsensor one or the button one)

2-print the design. the one with the phantom is the front. the other one is the back. back is optional, just have some guides of where you should put your the board and other stuff. 

3- fold and cut. cut is just the tiny part selected, in order to put there the button/sensor

4- fold in the middle line and in the line that says "FOLD" over it, after cutting the button gap. 

5- you can assure your model cutting the lines in the sides, which lets you tie a cord. 

6- have scary-fun!
